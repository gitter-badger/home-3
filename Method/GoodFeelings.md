Feeling love or compassion or feeling pride or triumphant definitely feels good.  And good feelings are better than bad feelings.  They are not equal.  Feeling good is always better than feeling bad.  Use the good feeling to spring board to more felicitous and harmless ones.  Vineeto specifically said that to me early on in the trip.  And she said it matter of factly.  I think she said **"Obviously good feelings are better than bad ones.  You can use them to get to feeling felicitous."** 

It must be a lot easier to jump from good yet ultimately harmful feelings to good and innocuous feelings than it is to get out of feeling bad and into a felicitous and harmless state.  So enjoy the good yet not entirely harmless feeling but don't indulge it.  Ask yourself: Does this feel better than enjoying and appreciating being alive? Next time, you are enjoying and appreciating the simple act of living and the simple state of being alive, note it.  How does it compare?  Then use that memory for comparison when any other feelings (good or bad) that may arise throughout the day.  Richard taught me to do that on one of that last days when I announced that I was feeling excellent.  He taught me to note it and feel what it feels like so I can use the memory of it later.
