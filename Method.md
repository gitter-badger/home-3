**RICHARD**: [...] consistently enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive is what the actualism method is. -[This Moment Of Being Alive](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/thismomentofbeingalive.htm).

Below you will find the Actualism method described using the very words of the feeling beings themselves (cross-references to the relevant Yahoo! list post is recommended).

Actualism can be practiced by asking yourself and then sincerely answering a few questions:

1. How am I experiencing this moment of being alive? (if your mood is not happy and harmless proceed to 2)
2. When was the last time I was feeling happy and harmless? (note that usually there are brief periods of feeling this way throughout even a bad day)
3. What specific event changed those feelings? What part of my identity was affected?
4. Would it have been better for myself and others to remain happy and harmless?

Deeply realizing that it would have been better to remain happy and harmless leads to returning to a happy and harmless mood. When this doesn't work then go back through the questions more carefully and more honestly. Sometimes you are feeling bad for reasons other than what you assumed, sometimes you only pretend to see that feeling good is the sensible option. Spend some time just waiting and watching the emotion if you are really stuck in a bad mood, as they always subside given time. After they do subside then restart the inquiry while your memory of the feeling is still fresh. Be sure not to attempt to feel good by ignoring the emotion, as that will be only a short-lived escape.

The actualism method proceeds in stages: feeling good 99% of the time, feeling great 99% of the time, feeling happy/harmless 99% of the time, feeling perfect 99% of the time.

The initial goal is to establish feeling good as the **effortless baseline** (it should be one's default state of being, and it should not take any special effort to maintain), such that 'highs' and 'lows' (the good and bad feelings) rarely happen, and if they do happen at all their cause can be traced back to the last time feeling good, and one immediately gets back to the baseline.

Then, when feeling good as an effortless baseline is successfully established one up-levels the baseline to feeling happy and harmless; same tracking back to cause, etc. applies.

Similarly, up-level to feeling perfect (the sheer perfection of being alive).

All of this – feeling good, great, happy, harmless, perfect – is done to effect a deliberate **affective** immitation of the actual. And that imitative felicity/ innocuity in conjunction with sensuosity, evokes amazement, marvel and delight (naivete) - and which allows the overarching benignity and benevolence (BnB) inherent to the infinitude (as evidenced in a PCE) to operate more and more freely. This intrinsic BnB, which has nothing to do with the aforementioned affective immitation (the stages), will do the rest.

Alright, so there is one another thing (which I had to learn only recently) I failed to emphasize in this summary of my understanding of the method. It is important to get back to feeling good *before* investigating and exploring the pinpointed issue that brought up the feeling. I find that if I go about investigating and exploring *while* feeling even slightly bad, some part of me is tacitly holding back (invested in the issue), thus making the whole enterprise futile leading to spiraling around the same old patterns. So, what do I do here?

  1. Catch myself no longer feeling good
  2. What am I feeling now? Feeling bad (about <whatever>)
  3. When was I feeling good last? A few seconds ago.
  4. Pinpoint the incident/ situation/ thoughts/ memories that triggered the bad feeling.
  5. Remind myself that I'll explore that in detail *after* getting back to feeling good.
  6. Now, realize that this is the only moment of being alive (the past and future do not exist now)
  7. I have two choices: continue to feel bad (as I do right now) and waste this only moment of being alive, or feel good.
  8. I know I was feeling good a few seconds ago, and it was obviously great to feel that, and obviously silly to feel bad. Why silly? *Specifically* because this moment, that is right in front of me here, is ALL that I have got right now. I mean, *literally*. There are objects, events and people 'happening' here in this moment. The past and future are not 'happening' - thus pale into insignifance. How do I choose to spend this ongoing moment, the only moment?
  9. I'm back to feeling good! Please note that there should virtually be no 'leftover' of the bad feeling. You are genuinely feeling good. No longer feeling bad (even though it might resurface later, you are currently not feeling it).
  10. Begin to explore the issue in question, so that its future occurrences are minimized. (More on point 10 perhaps in a later email).

The actualism method is really really simple. But I guess for this particular reason one can get it so wrong. One can also be distracted by a myriad other things on the AFT website, bring one’s own biases in and needlessly complicate it. Also it is quite contradictory to the habitual way we 'deal' with emotions.
 
I feel that before I [went into Ballina](/2015BallinaTrip), I was putting the actualism method into practice only occasionally (Assuming there can even be such a thing as occasional actualism practice – there can’t. Doing that is sorta like jogging in one place while kidding yourself that you’re running around the park heading towards the Actual Freedom finish line) - and even then more by accident than intentionally. I had an understanding of actualism that was rather like some Frankenstein’s monster that I had clumsily assembled together from all the reading of the site and chatting on the forum. It seemed like it was getting ever more unwieldy and top-heavy.
 
But still the forum and website were critical in getting me to an understanding that allowed the ‘last mile’ simple clarifications of Richard, Vineeto and Peter to be understood.
 
**Actualism Method**: Fully feel the bad feelings sans defensiveness, supression or any actualist shouldism. Then once you’ve felt all the feelings fully (and any reactions to those feelings also) its way easier to make a sincere informed choice to prefer feel good and see the silliness. Just like choosing your favourite ice-cream flavor. You naturally see the silliness and aren’t kidding yourself. Keep doing that each moment again – that’s it! Realise that it is good to feel good. 
 
Sure its not always easy but realizing that feeling good is just a mild happiness, a mild contentment as opposed to some tremendous happiness (that would be feeling great) – just  makes things a 100 times easier.  Like Adam said one morning ‘You need to have really low standards for feeling good’.  A bit of contentment and you go ‘I’ll take that! I like it’. Taking the actualist ethic out of it and just being honest about all your feelings also makes it way easier.
 
The other thing that was a big one for me was **Hedonic Tone**. This also relates to ‘over-idealising the feeling good’ lesson. Basically it’s the way one feels about a feeling. It can make all the difference between continuing to feel good or beating up on yourself and destroying the happiness you have achieved. So you can sometimes have a situation where you are having a little bit of a bad feeling you are exploring or you have noticed and started to see the silliness. In those cases you can have a lingering bad feeling while having a predominantly good hedonic tone – that’s fine. Don't demonise it. You can continue to explore it if you like, see the silliness of it, leave it there (if you are prone to beating yourself up) or pat yourself on the back for the fact that you are predominantly feeling good. That applies to ‘good feelings’ too. Emotional states aren’t rigid mutual exclusives and as long as you’re not kidding yourself and genuinely mostly feeling good its just fine and dandy.
