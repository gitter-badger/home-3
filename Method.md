**RICHARD**: [...] consistently enjoying and appreciating this moment of being alive is what the actualism method is. -[This Moment Of Being Alive](http://actualfreedom.com.au/richard/articles/thismomentofbeingalive.htm).

Below you will find the Actualism method described using the very words of the feeling beings themselves (cross-references to the relevant Yahoo! list post is recommended).

Actualism can be practiced by asking yourself and then sincerely answering a few questions:

1. How am I experiencing this moment of being alive? (if your mood is not happy and harmless proceed to 2)
2. When was the last time I was feeling happy and harmless? (note that usually there are brief periods of feeling this way throughout even a bad day)
3. What specific event changed those feelings? What part of my identity was affected?
4. Would it have been better for myself and others to remain happy and harmless?

Deeply realizing that it would have been better to remain happy and harmless leads to returning to a happy and harmless mood. When this doesn't work then go back through the questions more carefully and more honestly. Sometimes you are feeling bad for reasons other than what you assumed, sometimes you only pretend to see that feeling good is the sensible option. Spend some time just waiting and watching the emotion if you are really stuck in a bad mood, as they always subside given time. After they do subside then restart the inquiry while your memory of the feeling is still fresh. Be sure not to attempt to feel good by ignoring the emotion, as that will be only a short-lived escape.

Take particular note of the second last paragraph - it is up to each and every person to discover their own path and it will be different (to a greater or lesser extent) for every person.

Know thoroughly what it is you are feeling now. Dubble and trippple check to see if you are repressing anything.  And if you are feeling good then note it and enjoy and apprecitate living life so easily.  If you are feeling bad then pinpoint the specific trigger, feel out the feeling completely, remember what feeling good felt like and then consciously ask which you would rather feel.  You can't will yourself to feel good but you can allow yourself to do so.  

If it becomes clear that you prefer feeling worse than good then allow yourself that option because badgering yourself doesn't work. You may simply need more time to see for yourself that feeling worse isn't helpful.  If after ample time given and the feeling persist then consciuosly ask if you are induling the feeling.  And feel that question out.  Indulgence is a crafty to way to express a feeling without acting out or even thinking the thoughts that typically come with that feeling.  

At all times, allow yourself to feel good.  Give yourself permission to feel good.  When the dark clouds separate and allow even the thinnest of a lone sun beam to enter, allow yourself to feel that slight warmth and from that position you will know with all of your being that feeling better is more sensible than feeling worse. 

It comes highly recommended to regard your fellow human beings as being completely independent of you.  This will do several things.  It will free you from the burdens of morality.  Morality and felicity don't mix.  Fortunately seeing a human being as completely independent and every bit as interesting with every right to forge ahead as they see fit does away with the need for morality.  I'm not saying it will go away in one fell swoop (nor should it) but, firsthand, I am seeing how it's not necessary when I see the other as completely independent.   When it becomes evident that you aren't regarding them in that way, it will force you to feel yourself out fully to search for buried negativity.  In such times, I find it just under the surface and I have to concede that I have fallen below my baseline even if there is no specific trigger I can recall.  It just so happens that I had been fooling myself for an indertiminate amount of time. (I suspect that it's still a good idea to pinpoint a trigger for future reference.)

It also allows life to happen much more spontaneously. Having fun and being less affected gets reinforced.  Everyone has a story and everyones mood becomes interesting.  Society is now more like a garden. I see everyone in ever changing states and as long as I don't take their moods and their other petty behaviors seriously then my life is more lively because of it.  I also see that the only way to help them is to feel good and regard them as completely independent human beings with a rightful place to be in whatever shared circumstances we find ourselves in.  Whenever I recognize that I don't feel good, I  often start by asking if I genuinly respect these people around me.

The actualism method proceeds in stages: feeling good 99% of the time, feeling great 99% of the time, feeling happy/harmless 99% of the time, feeling perfect 99% of the time.

The initial goal is to establish feeling good as the **effortless baseline** (it should be one's default state of being, and it should not take any special effort to maintain), such that 'highs' and 'lows' (the good and bad feelings) rarely happen, and if they do happen at all their cause can be traced back to the last time feeling good, and one immediately gets back to the baseline.

Then, when feeling good as an effortless baseline is successfully established one up-levels the baseline to feeling happy and harmless; same tracking back to cause, etc. applies.

Similarly, up-level to feeling perfect (the sheer perfection of being alive).

All of this – feeling good, great, happy, harmless, perfect – is done to effect a deliberate **affective** immitation of the actual. And that imitative felicity/ innocuity in conjunction with sensuosity, evokes amazement, marvel and delight (naivete) - and which allows the overarching benignity and benevolence (BnB) inherent to the infinitude (as evidenced in a PCE) to operate more and more freely. This intrinsic BnB, which has nothing to do with the aforementioned affective immitation (the stages), will do the rest.

Alright, so there is one another thing (which I had to learn only recently) I failed to emphasize in this summary of my understanding of the method. It is important to get back to feeling good *before* investigating and exploring the pinpointed issue that brought up the feeling. I find that if I go about investigating and exploring *while* feeling even slightly bad, some part of me is tacitly holding back (invested in the issue), thus making the whole enterprise futile leading to spiraling around the same old patterns. So, what do I do here?

  1. Catch myself no longer feeling good
  2. What am I feeling now? Feeling bad (about _whatever_)
  3. When was I feeling good last? A few seconds ago.
  4. Pinpoint the incident/ situation/ thoughts/ memories that triggered the bad feeling.
  5. Remind myself that I'll explore that in detail *after* getting back to feeling good.
  6. Now, realize that this is the only moment of being alive (the past and future do not exist now)
  7. I have two choices: continue to feel bad (as I do right now) and waste this only moment of being alive, or feel good.
  8. I know I was feeling good a few seconds ago, and it was obviously great to feel that, and obviously silly to feel bad. Why silly? *Specifically* because this moment, that is right in front of me here, is ALL that I have got right now. I mean, *literally*. There are objects, events and people 'happening' here in this moment. The past and future are not 'happening' - thus pale into insignifance. How do I choose to spend this ongoing moment, the only moment?
  9. I'm back to feeling good! Please note that there should virtually be no 'leftover' of the bad feeling. You are genuinely feeling good. No longer feeling bad (even though it might resurface later, you are currently not feeling it).
  10. Begin to explore the issue in question, so that its future occurrences are minimized. (More on point 10 perhaps in a later email).

The actualism method is really really simple. But I guess for this particular reason one can get it so wrong. One can also be distracted by a myriad other things on the AFT website, bring one’s own biases in and needlessly complicate it. Also it is quite contradictory to the habitual way we 'deal' with emotions.
 
I feel that before I [went into Ballina](/BallinaTrip/2015), I was putting the actualism method into practice only occasionally (Assuming there can even be such a thing as occasional actualism practice – there can’t. Doing that is sorta like jogging in one place while kidding yourself that you’re running around the park heading towards the Actual Freedom finish line). I had an understanding of actualism that was rather like some Frankenstein’s monster that I had clumsily assembled together from all the reading of the site and chatting on the forum. It seemed like it was getting ever more unwieldy and top-heavy.
 
But still the forum and website were critical in getting me to an understanding that allowed the ‘last mile’ simple clarifications of Richard, Vineeto and Peter to be understood.
 
**Actualism Method**: Its all about feeling good all the time. The moment you pick up you aren't feeling good then there's work to be done. In this case, fully feel the bad feelings without defensiveness, supression, shame or 'shouldism': i.e. I should be feeling good damn me! Then once you’ve felt all the feelings fully - and acknowledged any of the above mentioned reactions to those feelings also - its easier to make a sincere informed choice to prefer to feel good and see the silliness of feeling bad. Its just like choosing your favourite ice-cream flavor. You naturally see the silliness of continuing to feel bad. That’s it! Realise that it is good to feel good.

If you are struggling with this don't worry. It does take a fair bit of effort and practise - especially at the start. After-all you are going against a lot of natural and personal conditioning. Keep the following things in mind and it will make things easier:

1) Persistence and consistency is key. The more you do this the easier it will become and the more momentum you'll build.

2) As the others have mentioned - Be as precise as possible with when exactly your mood dipped, what caused it and what emotions were experienced.

3) Find out how you started feeling good again. Make a mental note re: this. We spendless endless hours probing how and why we feel bad but rarely examine when and how we started to feel good. 

4) Read the AFT website to give yourself context in which to situate this simple practise. Understand the 'Big Picture' that is Actual Freedom and how amazing and radical 'The Wide and Wondrous Path' is. Understand the potency of feeling good and where it can lead.

5) Understand experientialy that there is only this moment. Realise that past and future don't exist. This takes work too, as 'past' and 'future' are very compelling illusions. Spend time contemplating this until you get it and don't just adopt any new-agey beliefs e.g. 'the power of now'.

6) If you are having difficulty seeing the silliness, 9 times out of 10 it is because the bad feelings are too strong and compelling. You will need to **get back to feeling neutal first**. Don't try and be a hero with tackling feelings, it will not work and you will just lose motivation. Getting to neutral can be a suprsingly easy and effective strategy as boring as it sounds! From there move to feeling good. From this position you'll have a lot more clarity and space to see why you felt bad and how you felt good.  
 
7) Realize that feeling good is just a mild happiness, a mild contentment as opposed to some tremendous happiness (that would be feeling great) – just  makes things a 100 times easier.  Like Adam said one morning ‘You need to have really low standards for feeling good’.  A bit of contentment and you go ‘I’ll take that! I like it’. You purposely give yourself an easy and generous target. Pat yourself on the back a lot for being able to do this. When you feel good for a while and it has become your natural baseline, then set the bar higher - all at your own pace.

8) If I notice a pattern whereby something repeatedly bothers me and makes me feel bad, then I know its a deeper issue than will need **investigating**. I will need to set time aside to go into this - sometimes even at the expense of feeling a bit bad. I will try to non-judgmentally evaluate what the feeling is about, what are the deeper fears and beliefs that this feeling brings up, looking for patterns where I felt similarly in other situations. The attitude I will try to have is a curiosity, a fascination, a non-judgmental stance - a 'how' approach rather than a 'why' approach. If I am stuck and start to get overwhelmed then as in 6) I know I'm just going in circles and need to feel neutral and good prior to investigating again.

9) See if you can bring a tenderness and sincerity towards yourself. It is 'you' that is doing all this work after-all. Be nice to yourself. This will help in the dropping of defences and feeling the feelings fully. It isn't bad to have emotions. It is 'our' very make-up as human beings.
