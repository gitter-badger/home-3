## Thou shalt feel good

"Thou shalt feel good" is an amusing way to phrase an "Actualist ethic" a practitioner has unwittingly taken on where they attempt to feel good only as an ethic while, deep down, continuing to choose to feel good or bad feelings.

## Not keeping it simple

A practitioner may commonly end up avoiding the simplicity of the actualism method: feeling good each moment again.



## Aiming too high

Srinath:
> Sure its not always easy but realizing that feeling good is just a mild happiness, a mild contentment as opposed to some tremendous happiness (that would be feeling great) – just  makes things a 100 times easier.  Like Adam said one morning ‘You need to have really low standards for feeling good’.  A bit of contentment and you go ‘I’ll take that! I like it’. Taking the actualist ethic out of it and just being honest about all your feelings also makes it way easier.


## Abstract Actualism

Failing to pinpoint and investigate the exact causes of emotional reactions, and philosophizing in general about why it is silly to feel bad. By being very specific and careful about why exactly you are feeling bad, you can be very specific about why it is silly to feel bad. This sort of specificity will make the investigation more "real" and it will have an effect on emotions not just intellect.

[Adam H.](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/actualfreedom/conversations/messages/18760):
> One thing I have started doing is recording every time I am in a bad mood. I just write down some answers to a few categories for each time: what am I feeling now?, when was I feeling good last?, what happened to end those felicitous/innocuous feelings, was it silly or sensible to change from feeling good to feeling otherwise? 
> e.g.: (I am feeling annoyed now I was last feeling good when I was in the car. My friend was high and taking a long time to get his snowboard on, and I just wanted to go which made me annoyed. I also felt indignant that I had to be the one waiting on him as if he was so important. It was silly to get annoyed about that, I could have enjoyed just sitting there waiting, and I wouldn't have created a conflict between me and him which I just ended up feeling guilty about later. All that could have been avoided if I was just enjoying my time rather than getting annoyed.)
> This seems like a pretty good approach, for one thing I get to record all the causes of feeling bad, for another I get to see how long periods of feeling good last because I date the entries. I also keep myself focused on *pinpointing* exactly what it was that sent me away from feeling good, otherwise I tend to practice Actualism with some reliance on abstraction and generalization.

## Become free later, but not happy now

Intellectually wanting Actual Freedom and the associated good
qualities, but not prioritizing feeling good each and every moment.

<https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/actualfreedom/conversations/messages/18879>

> SRINATH (paraphrasing Richard's practical advice): [... Practice]
being objective and fact based about objective material stuff e.g:
research, news, events in life - you can bring the objectivity to your
subjective inner world where it will be harder. [...] Facts = logic + senses

> SHASHANK: [... snip 112 words of philosophical thought ...] the point is
not to become an arbiter of authenticity of logic, but to experience
the sensate world directly.

> SRID: Aren't you [aiming too high](http://www.actualists.net/Mistakes#aiming-too-high) too soon by making it a point to
experience the sensate world directly [instead of](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/actualfreedom/conversations/messages/18850) aiming to keep
feeling good **no matter what**?

> SHASHANK: No I'm not because the said point to experience the sensate
world is the final point. Ofcourse, I know very well, that if I have
to reach the top of the mountain, I need to focus on the road - which
is to feel good no matter what.

> CLAUDIU: Actually the final point is the same as the way to get there: 

>> RICHARD: Note: [&#x2026;] consistently enjoying and appreciating this
moment of being alive is what the actualism method is. And this is
because the actualism method is all about consciously and knowingly
imitating life in the actual world. Also, by virtue of proceeding in
this manner the means to the end – an ongoing enjoyment and
appreciation – **are no different to the end itself**.

> The final point isn't to experience the sensate world. It is to enjoy
and appreciate being alive. Everything else is merely the best way to
facilitate that.

> That is, you're not feeling good so down the line you can experience
the sensate world&#x2026; you're feeling good so that you can enjoy and
appreciate being alive, and also somewhere down the line that will
become experiencing the sensate world because that is more enjoyable
than not.
