## Thou shalt feel good

"Thou shalt feel good" is an amusing way to phrase an "Actualist ethic" a practitioner has unwittingly taken on where they attempt to feel good only as an ethic while, deep down, continuing to choose to feel good or bad feelings.

## Over-complicating the actualism method

A practitioner may commonly end up avoiding the simplicity of the actualism method: feeling good each moment again.



## Setting too high a standard for feeling good

Srinath: "Sure its not always easy but realizing that feeling good is just a mild happiness, a mild contentment as opposed to some tremendous happiness (that would be feeling great) – just  makes things a 100 times easier.  Like Adam said one morning ‘You need to have really low standards for feeling good’.  A bit of contentment and you go ‘I’ll take that! I like it’. Taking the actualist ethic out of it and just being honest about all your feelings also makes it way easier."
