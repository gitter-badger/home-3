## Thou shalt feel good

"Thou shalt feel good" is an amusing way to phrase an "Actualist ethic" a practitioner has unwittingly taken on where they attempt to feel good only as an ethic while, deep down, continuing to choose to feel good or bad feelings.

## Not keeping it simple

A practitioner may commonly end up avoiding the simplicity of the actualism method: feeling good each moment again.



## Aiming too high

Srinath:
> Sure its not always easy but realizing that feeling good is just a mild happiness, a mild contentment as opposed to some tremendous happiness (that would be feeling great) – just  makes things a 100 times easier.  Like Adam said one morning ‘You need to have really low standards for feeling good’.  A bit of contentment and you go ‘I’ll take that! I like it’. Taking the actualist ethic out of it and just being honest about all your feelings also makes it way easier.


## Abstract Actualism

Failing to pinpoint and investigate the exact causes of emotional reactions, and philosophizing in general about why it is silly to feel bad. By being very specific and careful about why exactly you are feeling bad, you can be very specific about why it is silly to feel bad. This sort of specificity will make the investigation more "real" and it will have an effect on emotions not just intellect.

[Adam H.](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/actualfreedom/conversations/messages/18760):
> One thing I have started doing is recording every time I am in a bad mood. I just write down some answers to a few categories for each time: what am I feeling now?, when was I feeling good last?, what happened to end those felicitous/innocuous feelings, was it silly or sensible to change from feeling good to feeling otherwise? 
> e.g.: (I am feeling annoyed now I was last feeling good when I was in the car. My friend was high and taking a long time to get his snowboard on, and I just wanted to go which made me annoyed. I also felt indignant that I had to be the one waiting on him as if he was so important. It was silly to get annoyed about that, I could have enjoyed just sitting there waiting, and I wouldn't have created a conflict between me and him which I just ended up feeling guilty about later. All that could have been avoided if I was just enjoying my time rather than getting annoyed.)
> This seems like a pretty good approach, for one thing I get to record all the causes of feeling bad, for another I get to see how long periods of feeling good last because I date the entries. I also keep myself focused on *pinpointing* exactly what it was that sent me away from feeling good, otherwise I tend to practice Actualism with some reliance on abstraction and generalization.
