Anybody -- yes, _anybody_ -- can edit the pages on this site. Edits can also be reverted as the entire revision of every page is stored on the server. 

The primary aim of this wiki is to allow practicing [actualists](http://actualfreedom.com.au) to keep notes and share with other fellow practitioners. The wiki may be considered as an adjunct resource to [the Yahoo! list](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/actualfreedom/conversations/messages).
